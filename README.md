# OOP-Javaproject
This project is a simulation for the Egyptian FootBall League, that contains the names of the actual teams, players, rates and real rules of the game. The program
has three options to choose from, how the League will be played.. 1-Random (which will keep the Egyptian League teams but randomise the rate.) 2-Customized(which 
will let you create your own teams with your own rate, Would be Usefull at the collage made leagues and Ramadan Leagues for example.) 3- The Egptian Premire League
(Which will use the real teams with their real player rates to calculate the Real average rate of each team.)
The program will then introduce you to two Options either 1- It Displays the Resutlts in the moment, or 2- You Play The League Yourself!
If you choose to play the league you will be able to to perform 7 actions in the game: 
1- Score a goal.
2-Give a red Card to the opponent team.
3-Give a Yellow Card to the opponent team.
4-Let the opponent team Score a goal.
5-Give a red Card to the your team.
6-Give a Yellow Card to the your team.
7-End the Match. 
Each action will affect the results of the game either in your advantiage or against it. 
After the League Is finished, the program will display a GUI table to showcase the ranking of the teams according to the score they have gained throught the league.

Code Lines : 654 Line (without the description)
One Last note: Everything is unpredictable just like real life, The Ahli team will not always win the league just because it has the highest rate, There is always a 
chance for small teams to win, Just like Real Life!
